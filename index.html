    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a curious and driven student with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
      I enjoy building practical tools and exploring the logic behind systems and machines.
      Whether it's automating tasks or playing around with chess algorithms, I'm always looking to learn something new.
